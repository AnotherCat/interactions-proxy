# Interactions Proxy

A discord application build off cloudflare workers to proxy messages to fronts. Based off the ideas from pluralkit.  
I made this because the way pluralkit sends messages, it deletes the systems message, causes a flash like effect which has caused issues for photosensitive people. The intention of this project is to bridge that gap, because ephemeral response with slash commands are not seen by anyone but the original user.  

## Disclaimer

I do not intend for this to replace plural kit or other bots, I actually think pluralkit has slash command support planned.

## Setup

Follow the instructions in each readme in each directory.
