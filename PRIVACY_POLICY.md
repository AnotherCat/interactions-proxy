## Where do we store your data

Data is currently stored on Cloudflares servers and on a server in the US.

## Why do we need that data

### To provide functionality

User/Front related data is required to be able to proxy messages to that front.
Webhook related data is required to be able to proxy messages to a channel, without hitting discord ratelimits.
Message related data is required for moderation, ie to see which discord account send which message.

### To help us improve the Service

Data may also be used in development and testing.
